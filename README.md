# Week 2: A Responsive Portfolio
---
- **For:** Northwestern Coding Bootcamp
- **Developer:** Kat Eng
- **Deployment Date** 09/16/2018
- **Built With** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap


### Description & Requirements
---
For this assignment we were tasked with revamping our vanilla CSS portfolios with Bootstrap CSS framework. We were given the following requirements to meet:

1. Use Bootstrap to create a *nav-bar*
2. Create a responsive layout using the Bootsrap grid system
3. Responsive Images


### Notes
---
This was the first project that I ever did with Bootstrap. After looking at the code, I am sure I could do a lot more with it. I plan on revisiting this code again after the class ends.
